This project uses supervised learning techniques on US census data to assist CharityML (a fictitious charity organisation) in identifying groups of people who are most likely to donate to their cause.

-Based on real census data, Investigated the factors that influence the likelihood of charitable donations being made. To compare testing results to, Created a naive classifier. On preprocessed census data,Â trained and tested several supervised machine learning models to predict the likelihood of donations. picked the most accurate model based on algorithm effectiveness, a modified F-scoring metric, and accuracy.

### Code

The main code for this project can be found in the notebook file 'finding donors.ipynb', 'visuals.py' contains additional supporting code for visualising the required graphs.

### Data

The modified census dataset consists of approximately 32,000 data points, with each datapoint having 13 features. This dataset is a modified version of the dataset published in the paper *"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: a Decision-Tree Hybrid",* by Ron Kohavi. You may find this paper [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf), with the original dataset hosted on [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income).
